## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Login First
1. Go to `http://localhost:5173/auth/signup`
2. Sign up as User or Admin
3. Verify you're redirected to dashboard
4. Check browser console for token storage logs

### Step 2: Test Delete Account
1. Go to `http://localhost:5173/test-delete`
2. Click "Test Delete Account" button
3. Check browser console for detailed logs
4. Check backend terminal for server logs

### Step 3: Check Backend Logs
Look for these messages in the backend terminal:
```
DELETE /user/delete-account route hit
Auth header: Bearer <token>
Token: <token>
Decoded token: { userId: "...", ... }
Deleting user with ID: <id>
User account deleted successfully
```

Delete account - Role: user
Delete account - Token: <jwt-token>
Delete account response status: 200
```

### Backend Terminal Logs
When the API is called, you should see:
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Route not found" or 404
**Solution:** Backend server needs to be restarted
```bash
cd backend
node index.js
```

### Issue: "Invalid token"
**Solution:** Token might be expired or malformed
1. Check localStorage in browser DevTools
2. Try logging in again
3. Check if JWT_SECRET is set in backend .env

### Issue: "Cannot connect to server"
**Solution:** Backend not running
1. Check if backend is running on port 3000
2. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to verify
3. Restart backend if needed

### Issue: CORS errors
**Solution:** Check CORS configuration
1. Verify `FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173` in backend .env
2. Restart backend after changing .env

## 📋 Current Status

### ✅ Working Features
- Backend delete account routes exist and are accessible
- Frontend makes API calls with proper authentication
- Debug logging shows request/response details
- Test page available for debugging

### 🔧 Backend Endpoints
- `DELETE /user/delete-account` - ✅ Working
- `DELETE /admin/delete-account` - ✅ Working
- Both require Bearer token authentication
- Both delete related data before deleting account

### 🎯 Frontend Routes
- `/test-delete` - Test page for debugging
- Navbar dropdown delete button
- Settings page delete button

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Testing
1. **Login** → Go to `/test-delete` → Click test button
2. **Check console logs** → Look for detailed request/response info
3. **Check backend logs** → Look for route hit messages
4. **Try actual delete** → Use navbar dropdown or settings page

### If Still Not Working
1. **Check browser console** for any JavaScript errors
2. **Check backend terminal** for any server errors
3. **Verify token format** in localStorage
4. **Test with curl/Postman** to isolate frontend vs backend issues

The delete account routes are now properly implemented with extensive debugging. Use the test page to identify exactly where the issue is occurring.
